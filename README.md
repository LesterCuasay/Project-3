![amiresponsive](docs/images/amiresponsive.png)

Welcome to my 3rd Project for Code Institute, this project consist of solely Python to which i created a Hangman game! The project is deployed through [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).

From the start, it will give an brief introduction letting the user know what the game is about, showing them brief rules of the game. To then the player is prompt to press "Enter" to start the game; this will then prompt the user for their name to start the game.

The game consists of 6 tries, every letter or word guesses will lower the tries you have for the game. After 6 tries being used and you do not guess the word you will lose the game, though if you were succesful during the 6 tries and managed to guess the word then you win the game!

The deployed project can be found here - [Hangman](https://project-3-hangman-ci.herokuapp.com/)
